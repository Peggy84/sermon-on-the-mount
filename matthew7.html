      <h2>Observation &amp; Reflection</h2>
      <p class="subheading">(Matthew 7 focus)</p>

      <p>
        <strong>1. What contrasts does Jesus use in this chapter?</strong><br>
        Wide and narrow gates, healthy and diseased trees, wise and foolish builders.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>2. How does Jesus describe genuine discipleship?</strong><br>
        Look for phrases about doing his words, not just hearing them.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>3. Where is Jesus inviting you to build more firmly on the “rock” of his teaching?</strong><br>
        Write one step of obedience you sense from this passage.
