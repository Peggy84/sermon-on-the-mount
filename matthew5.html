      <h2>Observation &amp; Reflection</h2>
      <p class="subheading">(Matthew 5 focus)</p>

      <p>
        <strong>1. Who does Jesus call “blessed”?</strong><br>
        List each group (poor in spirit, mourning, meek, etc.) and what they receive.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>2. How do these blessings challenge common ideas of success or happiness?</strong><br>
        Where do you feel tension between Jesus’ words and cultural values?
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>3. Choose one Beatitude as a prayer for today.</strong><br>
        For example: “Lord, teach me what it means to be poor in spirit and depend fully on you.”
